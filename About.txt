In this program, we use the Scanner class to read input from the user. We prompt the user to enter a number with the message "Enter a number: ". The nextInt() method of the Scanner class is used to read an integer from the user.

We then use an if-else statement to check if the number is positive or negative. If the number is greater than 0, we print "The number is positive." If the number is less than 0, we print "The number is negative." If the number is equal to 0, we print "The number is zero."
